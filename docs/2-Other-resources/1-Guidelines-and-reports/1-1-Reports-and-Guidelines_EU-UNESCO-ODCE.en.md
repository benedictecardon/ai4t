*Foreword*
While defining the objectives of the AI4T project, the project promoters drew on a range of reports and contributions from different institutions. Those refrenecs has been updated with new developments / pubi-lished since 2020 when the project was written.

# European Union Legal Publications

**In progress**: Regulatory framework proposal on artificial intelligence[^4]
*"The Commission is proposing the first-ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally"*

!!! Note "Extract"
    *The proposed AI regulation ensures that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes.*

!!! Example "Notable content"
This Regulatory Framework defines 4 levels of risk in AI:
  1 - Unacceptable risk  
  2 - High risk  
  3 - Limited risk  
  4 - Minimal or no risk

  **Educational or vocational training** are assessed as **2 - High risk** "*as that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone's life (e.g. scoring of exams).*"


# European Union policy : The Digital Education Action Plan

!!! Note ""
*A policy initiative that sets out a common vision of high-quality, inclusive and accessible digital education in Europe, and aims to support the adaptation of the education and training systems of Member States to the digital age.*

Notable content: "*These include the classification of AI according to: families of algorithms and the theoretical models behind them; cognitive abilities reproduced by AI; functions performed by AI. Applications of AI may be grouped also according to other dimensions, like the economic sector in which such applications are found, or their business functions.*"(see below)

2021: AI and Education: Guidance for Policy-Makers- UNESCO[^15]

2020: AI Watch - Defining Artificial intelligence[^8] -  A publication from High-level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence

!!! note
  A proposal for "*an operational definition of artificial intelligence to be adopted in the context of AI Watch.* Notable content: "*A valuable contribution of this work is the collection of definitions developed between 1955 and 2019, and the summarisation of the main features of the concept of artificial intelligence as reflected in the relevant literature.*"

2020: AI in Education: Change at the Speed of Learning - UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education report[^18]

2020: Emerging technologies and the teaching profession [^7] - Ethical and pedagogical considerations based on near-future scenarios - A Joint Research Centre Report

!!! abstract
  "*The aim of the scenarios is to see the future as something to shape. These near-future scenarios aim to solve a number of problems that educators of today say prevent them from delivering quality education and training. They take place in classrooms, lecture halls, training centres and digital learning environments in which emerging technologies could be used to support educators in their profession. Key challenges emerging from the scenarios relate to ethical considerations (e.g. balance between human autonomy and machines, datafication of education, pedagogical models) and the evolving competence requirements of teaching professionals.*"

2019: The impact of AI on learning teaching and education[^6] - A Joint Research Centre Report

!!! abstract
  "A report that *describes the current state of the art in artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential impact for learning, teaching, and education. It provides conceptual foundations for well-informed policy-oriented work, research, and forward-looking activities that address the opportunities and challenges created by recent developments in AI. The report is aimed for policy developers, but it also makes contributions that are of interest for AI technology developers and researchers studying the impact of AI on economy, society, and the future of education and learning.*"

2019: Beijing Consensus on Artificial Intelligence and Education - UNESCO[^14]

2019: Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI[^11]

!!! info
  Those guidelines gave way to ALTAI: The Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence[^12], "*a practical tool that helps businesses and organisations to self-assess the trustworthiness of their AI systems under development.*"

2018: A Definition Of AI: Main Capabilities And Disciplines[^10]

!!! info
  "*This document expands the definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as defined in the Commission Communication on AI. It clarifies certain aspects of AI as a scientific discipline and as a technology, with the aim to avoid misunderstanding, to achieve a shared common knowledge of AI that can be fruitfully used also by non - AI experts, and to provide useful details that can be used in the discussion on both the AI ethics guidelines and the AI policies recommendations.*""
