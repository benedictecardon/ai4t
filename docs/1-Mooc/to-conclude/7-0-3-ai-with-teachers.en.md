# AI with Teachers

You are ongoing training or have finished it and have understood why AI was the new key actor in education. Perhaps have you had enough? Or, perhaps, you have more questions now than when you started?

Want to know a bit more about how AIED tools work? Want to understand why language is such an important topic for AI?

You might have understood that the consequences of AI in education go much further than the arrival of some fancy new applications: how do we go about examining these? How do we make sure that the teacher is in the loop?

If these are some of the questions you would like to see discussed, come and explore the AI4T textbook prepared by the AI4T team.  
But don't be disappointed if once again you end up with even more questions! If you feel you have understood your questions better, we believe we would have achieved something.

## AI with Teachers textbook

The goal of the "AI with Teachers" textbook is to go one step further in making teachers aware of AI and its role in your classroom: Of all the good things it could do, of the impact it will probably have and equally important, how we should be cautious.

The texbook is organised around 6 main chapters. Here is a short description:

### Why learn about AI

In this chapter we will bring you into the world of AI in the classroom.
Both of the AI the teachers will introduce and the one introduced by others. Our key argument is that AI is not going to arrive. It is already there.

### Finding information

Search engines and recommendation engines are used every day to find information. They rely on search and ranking algorithms which have made the economic success of some internet giants. We will try to understand how they work, how they handle -or don't, the biases. And of course (like in the other chapters) we discuss the ethical concerns we all share.

### Managing learning

AI is also used to deal with many aspects of the organisation of school life: scheduling and other logistic tasks. It also helps you manage learning through Learning Management systems and Analytics. We will try to understand the role of data and all the handling of data implies.

### Personalising learning

This is where AI becomes exciting: if it knows things about you (or your pupils)it can provide additional services. It can adapt to each learner. But to what Cost?

### Listening, Speaking and Writing

Language is at the core of this chapter. AI is getting better at language tasks: it can -sort-of- translate, transcribe, offer summaries and now even produce text. As all these are tasks very much linked with school activities, we should aim to understand how it works. You want to know about chatbots but not from a chatbot? Read this.

### The future

When preparing the textbook the authors found that there was so much beyond the tools accessible right now. The real impact of AI may not be in the technology but in the education itself. If we want to think about complex issues like cheating, exams, motivation, we should definitely read this chapter.

### Resources and Bibliography

We hope you enjoy the reading.
