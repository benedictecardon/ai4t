## How to translate the Mooc resources in another target languages.

1. **Texts**  
All texts files are accessible in HTML or Markdown format. Automatic translations (using the DeepL API) from the English version into the four languages of the consortium (DE, FR, IT, SL) has been provided from noevmber 2022.

3. **Videos with Voice-Over**  
- All the videos (the previouly existing ones from Mooc V1 and those produced for Mooc V2) will be provided with voice-over in the 4 languages of the consortium (except German for the Mooc V1 videos as requested by Luxembourg partner).
The Voice-over videos and their associated subtitles are produced by a sub-contractor (MyGustav). For a more efficient interaction, each partner interacts directly with MyGustav to check and correct the translated voice scripts of each original video before the voice-over is recorded. Each voice-over is produced by a native speaker.
- All the videos for each 5 language will be uploaded on the AI4T youTube Channel.

3. **Videos subtitles**
- Translated subtitles are available on the project AI4T YouTube channel.

4. **Tutorials**  
- Videos with voice-over have been integrated into the tutorials interface.
- Translated subtitles have been directly inserted in the tutorial.
